Ansible playbook(s) for automating the `Koji server install process
<https://docs.pagure.org/koji/server_howto/>`_.

This sets up the Kerberos (GSSAPI) method of authentication. I use this to
quickly set up Koji in VMs in OpenStack.

Playbooks
---------

* ``setup-koji.yml`` - Installs and configures a Kerberos KDC, koji-hub, and
  koji-builder.

Run this playbook on a RHEL or CentOS 7 or 8 host with EPEL enabled. /mnt/koji
should be a disk with plenty of space.

SSL configuration
-----------------

* This playbook generates an SSL CA and keypair using the `koji-ssl-admin tool
  <https://pagure.io/koji-tools/blob/master/f/src/bin/koji-ssl-admin>`_ .

  The Certificate Authority keypair:
    * ``/etc/pki/koji/koji-ca.crt``
    * ``/etc/pki/koji/koji-ca.key``

  The Apache web server HTTPS keypair (signed by koji-ca above):
    * ``/etc/pki/koji/kojidev.example.com.chain.crt``
    * ``/etc/pki/koji/kojidev.example.com.key``

  For GSSAPI (Kerberos) authentication, these are the only SSL certs you will
  need.

  The koji-hub role publishes the Koji CA at the following URL:
  https://kojidev.example.com/kojifiles/koji-ca.crt . External Koji clients
  can download this file to verify the HTTPS connections.

Hard-coded things
-----------------

This is a santized code drop from a set of internal playbooks, so several
things are currently hard-coded:

* The hostname is hardcoded in several places as "kojidev.example.com".

* The main username is hardcoded in several places as "kdreyer".


Roles
-----

* ``roles/kdc`` - installs and configures a Kerberos KDC, and bootstraps all
  the keytabs we need.

  This will create a "kdreyer" Kerberos account. The ``koji-hub`` role will
  bootstrap this account into Koji's database. If you need more Kerberos
  users, add them here.

* ``roles/koji-ssl-admin`` - Creates the SSL CA and HTTPS keypair for the Koji
  server.

* ``roles/koji-client`` - Configures a ``kojidev`` script and `profile
  <https://docs.pagure.org/koji/profiles/>`_.

* ``roles/postgresql`` - installs and configures PostgreSQL for Koji Hub

* ``roles/koji-hub`` - installs and configures Koji Hub

  This role requires the `koji_host
  <https://github.com/ktdreyer/koji-ansible/blob/master/library/koji_host.py>`_
  module from the `koji-ansible project
  <https://github.com/ktdreyer/koji-ansible>`_.

  This role will bootstrap "kdreyer" as the first Koji administrator in the
  database.

  If you need more users, add them with the `koji_user
  <https://github.com/ktdreyer/koji-ansible/blob/master/library/koji_user.py>`_
  module.

* ``roles/koji-web`` - installs and configures the web interface for Koji.

* ``roles/koji-builder`` - installs and configures a Koji builder.

* ``roles/koji-ra`` - installs and configures the Koji "ra" (repository admin)
  service.

* ``roles/koji-gc`` - installs and configures the Koji garbage collector
  service.
